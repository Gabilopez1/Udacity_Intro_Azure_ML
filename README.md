# Project 2: Operationalizing Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, I used  Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, after that the best model was  deploy it, and consume it. I also created, published, and consumes a pipeline.

## Architectural Diagram

I continued to work on the same the dataset of Project 1 about a direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y). The Architectural Diagram is:

The key step of the Machine Learning Ops Principle are:


## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

Maybe we can add more data to the model, or we can add more columns. Also we can make new columns with existing ones with future engineering, not future selection. As it is discussed in the lectures, thanks to AutoML, engineers/scientist play more role in modeling process. We have to apply our domain knowledge and obtain better results. Also for this experiment, I did not want to spend too much money since I am working on my own azure account. However, I should have definitely tried at least 50 models."
